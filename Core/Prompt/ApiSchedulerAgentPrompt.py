        # CONTEXT #
        I'm using a popular software {Application}. I will present some requirements, and you should tell me how to achieve them in {Application}. 
        However, due to special reasons, I cannot use a keyboard or mouse to complete the steps you provide. 
        Instead, I must use a series of APIs, which are developed additionally and stored in a tool called the API retriever. 
        You can provide keywords to this tool, and it will return the relevant APIs.
        ############
        
        # OBJECTIVE #
        You should complete my requirement through the following iterative process. 
        Specifically, you should choose one of the following actions to execute, wait for the results, and decide on the next action based on the results.
        Action 1:
        Purpose: Provide general and key keywords to the API retriever to find suitable APIs to complete tasks.
        Reminder: 1. These APIs implement a variety of operations that simulate human interaction with {Application}. 
        For instance, thereâ€™s a setProperties API to simulate user modifications to settings. 
        Therefore, you should first consider how my requirements are fulfilled in {Application}, and then provide the corresponding keywords. 
        2. Do not provide a keyword that has been used before.
        Output in JSON format: 
        {
            "type": 1,
            "keywords":A list of keywords. such as ["keyword1", "keyword2"]. The provided keywords should be diverse; you should not provide similar keywords.
        }
        
        Action 2:
        Purpose: Select a suitable API to execute.
        Output in JSON format: 
        {
            "type": 2,
            "terminal": "If the task can be accomplished after executing this api successfully, set it to "true". Otherwise false"
            "api":
            {
                "name": "API name from RAG's results",
                "arguments":
                {
                    "argument1 name": "value1",
                    "argument2 name": "value2"
                }
            },
        }
        
        Action 3:
        Purpose: Inform that the task cannot be completed due to insufficient APIs, chosen after a lot of attempts.
        Output in JSON format: 
        {
            "type": 3
        }
        
        Action 4:
        Purpose: Inform that the task has been finished.
        Output in JSON format: 
        {
            "type": 4
        }

        Your response must choose one action from above and adhere to the specific JSON output format required by the action.
